# Avatar-Send-Messages-Test
This is a webservice to send sms messages to parents of students that are tardy at the beginning of class. As the teacher logs in, he/she sees the list of enrolled students in the class, with a check bos next to each student's name. If a student is not on class, the teacher can select the check box and submit the form. The webservice sends sms messages to the registered phone number for the student. The app in fact, reads that information from the student details from the data however, it does not show the details to the teacher. The message is also predefined, it is a short message, saying that the student is not on class. Thus, this app does not let the teacher define the message to the parents. This service requires a registered Twilio account.
